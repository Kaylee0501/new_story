  In a remote village, about three miles from the small town of Minorton, there was an old house that was finally occupied by an old man. Since 1990, no one has
lived in it, and no one is likely to live in it again. Outsiders may not know it, but people living nearby knew that this was a famous haunted house. There was no
glass in the windows and no door at the door. There were many gaps in the shingle roof, and the windshield was gray due to lack of paint. No one wanted to
approach this house.
