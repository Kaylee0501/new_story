  In a remote village, about three miles from the small town of Minorton, there was an old house that was finally occupied by an old man. Since 1990, no one has
lived in it, and no one is likely to live in it again. Outsiders may not know it, but people living nearby knew that this was a famous haunted house. There was no
glass in the windows and no door at the door. There were many gaps in the shingle roof, and the windshield was gray due to lack of paint. No one wanted to
approach this house.

No one would even pass by the pavement outside this house. People would avoid looking at it, and  even talking about it to some extent. When the old man came here for the first time to look at it, people shot at him dirty looks. A man also approached him and offered to tell him the story of the hauntings that took place over a few decades ago. But the old man refused. He had never seen a ghost, and he weren't the one to believe in things he could not see. The house was being offered for very cheap, and the man had no family, so he took it. The house had 5 rooms, and it was decently big. For about a month, he lived a smooth life. he was retired and so always spent his day inside. But after a month, an incident took place that forced him to change some of his beliefs.
